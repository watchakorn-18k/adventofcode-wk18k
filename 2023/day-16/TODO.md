**Part 1: Beam Tracing**

This Python code implements a beam tracing algorithm to find the number of "energized" points in a grid of characters. It likely represents a puzzle or simulation involving lasers or light reflection.

**Key Points:**

- **Input:** Takes a file named "input" containing the grid data.
- **Data Structure:** Grid is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the grid.
- **Function:** `count_energized(grid, initial_beam)` is the workhorse, calculating the number of energized points reachable from a starting beam.

**Algorithm Flow:**

1. **Read Data:** Reads the grid data from the input file and stores it in the `grid` variable.
2. **Initialize Beams:** Creates a list named `beams` containing the starting beam(s) and an empty set for visited positions (`seen`) and energized points (`energized`).
3. **Loop:** While `beams` is not empty, iterate through each beam:
   - Check if the current beam position has already been visited. If yes, skip it.
   - Check if the beam is outside the grid boundaries. If yes, skip it.
   - Mark the current position as visited and add it to `energized`.
   - Based on the current grid character and the beam direction:
     - If the character is "/" or "\\", update the beam direction based on reflection rules.
     - If the character is "|" or "-", spawn two new beams with perpendicular directions.
     - Otherwise, keep the direction and move the beam one step forward.
   - Append the new beams (if any) to the `new_beams` list.
4. **Update Beams:** Replace `beams` with `new_beams` and repeat the loop until no more beams remain.
5. **Return Value:** The function returns the number of points in `energized`.

**Part 2: Finding Maximum Energized Points**

- This part finds the maximum number of energized points reachable from any starting point on the grid.
- It iterates through each row and column, treating each cell as a starting point for the `count_energized` function.
- It keeps track of the maximum number of energized points encountered during the iterations.
- Finally, it prints the maximum number as the solution for part 2.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code assumes the grid characters are valid for the specific puzzle/simulation rules.
- The `strip()` function removes whitespace from the input data.
- The `max()` function is used to compare and update the maximum energized points.
