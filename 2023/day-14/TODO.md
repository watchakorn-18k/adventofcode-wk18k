- **Imports:**
  - `itertools.count`: Generates an infinite sequence of consecutive integers.
- **Data Loading:**
  - `input.txt`: File containing the initial grid layout.
  - `ls`: List of lines in the file.
  - `board`: Dictionary mapping complex numbers (representing grid positions) to water ("O") or sand (".").
- **Function `tilt(board, d)`:**
  - Simulates tilting the grid in a specific direction (d).
  - Loops until no more water flows.
  - Checks each position:
    - If water is present and has sand below (in direction d), move water down and sand up.
    - Otherwise, keep the existing element.
  - Returns the updated board.
- **Function `load(board)`:**
  - Calculates the total score based on water depth.
  - For each water cell, subtracts its depth from 100.
  - Returns the sum of scores for all water cells.
- **Part 1:**
  - Calls `tilt(board)` repeatedly until the water stabilizes.
  - Prints the final score after stabilization.
- **Function `cycle(board)`:**
  - Tilts the board in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
  - Returns the final board after tilting all directions.
- **Part 2:**
  - Creates an empty `seen` list to track past board states.
  - Uses `count` to generate an infinite loop.
  - Tilts the board in all directions using `cycle(board)`.
  - Checks if the current board state has already been seen in `seen`.
    - If yes, calculates the cycle length ("start" - index) and remainder of iterations to reach the state again.
    - Uses the remainder to find the desired board state from the previously seen list.
  - Prints the score of the desired board state.

**Key Points:**

- The code uses complex numbers to represent positions in a two-dimensional grid.
- The main logic involves tilting the grid and moving water down while filling empty spaces with sand.
- Part 2 finds the repeating cycle of board states and uses it to efficiently calculate the desired score.
