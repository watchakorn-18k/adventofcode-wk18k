**1. Finding the fastest path with at most 3 steps (Part 1):**

- **Data Loading:**
  - The code reads the grid data from a file "input" where each line represents a row and each character is a number representing the cost of moving through that point.
  - A map called `grid` stores the cost for each (x, y) position.
- **Search Algorithm:**
  - A priority queue `q` is used to efficiently prioritize paths based on their current "heat" (sum of cell values visited).
  - The queue initially contains starting points at (1, 0) and (0, 1) with heat as their corresponding grid values and other information about direction and steps taken.
  - A `visited` set keeps track of explored paths to avoid revisiting them.
  - `end` stores the maximum value in the grid, which is the destination.
  - While the queue isn't empty:
    - The path with the lowest "heat" is popped from the queue.
    - If the destination is reached and the number of steps is already below a threshold (3 in Part 1), the path's total heat is returned as the optimal cost.
    - If the current path has already been explored, it's skipped.
    - Else, the current path is marked as visited.
    - If there are steps left (less than the maximum allowed), the next valid position based on the current direction is calculated and its heat is added to the grid value at that point. This new potential path is pushed to the queue with its updated information.
    - If the number of steps is already enough (at least 3 in Part 1), the code explores alternative paths by trying to turn left and right from the current position. If those positions are valid in the grid, they are pushed to the queue with their starting heat (grid value) and reset step count (0).
- **Output:** The code prints the minimum heat (optimal cost) for Part 1.

**2. Finding the fastest path with at most 10 steps (Part 2):**

- Same logic as Part 1, but the maximum allowed steps increase to 10 and the output prints the minimum heat for Part 2.
