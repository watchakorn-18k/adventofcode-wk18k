**Imports:**

- **sys:** Used for accessing command-line arguments (not used in this code).
- **z3:** A library for constraint programming and theorem proving.

**Functions:**

- **is_after(pos, vel, x, y):**

  - Checks if a point with position `pos` and velocity `vel` will be _after_ the point (`x`, `y`) in its trajectory.
  - Returns True if it will be after, False otherwise.

- **main1(data):**

  1. Reads input data (presumably positions and velocities of particles) from a file named "input".
  2. Processes each line of data:
     - Splits the line into position and velocity components.
     - Stores position, velocity, slope, and intercept for each particle in a list called `stones`.
  3. Iterates through pairs of particles to find intersections:
     - Calculates the intersection point for each pair (if slopes are different).
     - Checks if the intersection is within bounds and if both particles will be at that point _after_ their initial positions.
  4. Prints the count of valid intersections as "PART 1".

- **main2(data):**
  1. Reads input data from the same "input" file.
  2. Processes each line of data, storing position and velocity for each particle in the `stones` list.
  3. Uses the Z3 solver to find a solution that satisfies constraints:
     - Creates variables for the final resting point (`x`, `y`, `z`) and its velocity (`vx`, `vy`, `vz`).
     - Adds constraints for each particle, ensuring it reaches the resting point at some time `t_intercept`.
  4. Prints the value of `x + y + z` (the sum of coordinates of the resting point) as "PART 2".

**Main Execution:**

- Reads input data from "input" file.
- Calls both `main1` and `main2` functions for their respective calculations.

**Key Points:**

- The code addresses a problem involving particles moving in space with initial positions and velocities.
- It calculates two different things:
  - **Part 1:** The number of valid intersections between particle trajectories within a given boundary.
  - **Part 2:** The coordinates of the final resting point where all particles eventually converge.
- It uses the Z3 solver to find the solution for Part 2, which involves solving a system of equations.
