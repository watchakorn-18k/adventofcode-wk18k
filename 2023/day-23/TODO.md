1. **Part 1:** The path can follow any direction as indicated by the arrows.
2. **Part 2:** The path cannot follow slopes (i.e., it cannot change direction from up/down to left/right or vice versa).

**Key Components**

- **Data Structures:**

  - `Position2D`: Represents a position on the grid using row and column coordinates.
  - `Direction`: An enum representing the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
  - `defaultdict`: Used to create dictionaries with default values for missing keys.

- **Functions:**
  - `profiler(method)`: A decorator that measures the execution time of a function.
  - `longest_hike(input_lines)`: Solves Part 1 using a breadth-first search algorithm.
  - `longest_hike_without_slopes(input_lines)`: Solves Part 2 using a depth-first search algorithm with graph simplification.

**Input and Output:**

- **Input:** Reads data from a file named "input". Each line represents a row in the grid, with "#" representing obstacles and arrows indicating movement directions.
- **Output:** Prints the length of the longest hike for both Part 1 and Part 2.
