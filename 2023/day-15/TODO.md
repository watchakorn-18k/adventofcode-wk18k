**Part 1:**

- **Reading data:** The code opens the file "input" and reads its entire contents into the variable `data`. It then removes any whitespace at the beginning and end using `strip()`.
- **Calculating value:** It initializes a variable `t` to 0 and loops through each step in `data` split by commas.
- **Processing each step:**
  - It initializes a variable `v` to 0 and loops through each character in the current step.
  - For each character, it adds its ASCII code to `v` and multiplies it by 17. Finally, it takes the modulo by 256 to keep the value within a specific range.
  - The final value of `v` is added to `t`.
- **Printing result:** The code prints the value of `t` as "PART 1:"

**Part 2:**

- **Initializing boxes:** It creates a list of empty lists `boxes` of size 256, representing 256 possible values for `v`.
- **Processing each step:**
  - If the step contains `=`, it splits the step at the `=` to get the label and length of an element. The length is converted to an integer.
  - It calculates the value of `v` for the label using the same process as in Part 1.
  - It searches for an existing element with the same label in `boxes[v]`. If found, it updates its length. Otherwise, it adds a new element with the label and length to the list.
  - If the step ends with `-`, it treats it as a removal instruction. It calculates `v` for the label and removes all elements with that label from `boxes[v]`.
- **Calculating final value:** It initializes `t` to 0 and loops through each item in each sub-list of `boxes`.
- **Adding contributions:** For each item, it multiplies its length by the product of its position (i + 1) and the position of its sub-list (j + 1). These positions act as multipliers and contribute to the overall value based on their location within the data structure.
- **Summing contributions:** The final value of `t` is the sum of all these contributions.
- **Printing result:** The code prints the value of `t` as "PART 2:"
