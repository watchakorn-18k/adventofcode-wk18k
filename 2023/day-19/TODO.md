1. The code defines a function called `parse_workflows` that takes a string `data` as input. This function parses the workflows from the input data and returns a dictionary where the keys are workflow IDs and the values are lists of steps for each workflow.

2. The code defines a function called `evaluate_part1` that takes the parsed workflows and another string `data` as input. This function evaluates the workflows based on the provided data and returns a result. It iterates over parts of the data, extracts numbers from each part, and assigns them to variables `d`. Then, it follows the steps of the workflows until it reaches either workflow "A" or "R". If it reaches workflow "A", it sums the numbers from the data and adds them to the result.

3. The code defines a function called `evaluate_part2` that takes the parsed workflows as input. This function evaluates the workflows in a different way and returns a result. It uses a queue-based approach to process the workflows. It starts with a queue containing a tuple `(workflow, idx, bounds)`. While the queue is not empty, it pops a tuple from the queue and performs different operations based on the workflow and step. If the workflow is "A", it calculates a product based on the bounds of variables "x", "m", "a", and "s" and adds it to the result. If the workflow is "A" or "R" or the index `idx` exceeds the number of steps in the workflow, it continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, it processes the step by updating the bounds of a variable based on a condition (either "<" or ">") and creates two new tuples to be added to the queue for further processing.

4. The code reads input data from a file named "input" and splits it into sections based on double newline characters ("\n\n"). The first section is parsed as workflows using the `parse_workflows` function.

5. The code calls `evaluate_part1` with the parsed workflows and the second section of the data to calculate and print the result of "PART 1".

6. The code calls `evaluate_part2` with the parsed workflows to calculate and print the result of "PART 2".
