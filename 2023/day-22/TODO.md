1. The code begins with importing the `collections` and `copy` modules. Then, it defines a named tuple called `Brick` with three fields: `id`, `pos_a`, and `pos_b`. Each `Brick` represents a brick object with an ID and two positions in three-dimensional space.

2. Next, there are several helper functions defined:

   - `_parse_pos`: This function takes a string representing a position in the format "x,y,z" and returns a tuple of three integers.
   - `_parse_single_brick`: This function takes an ID and a string representing a brick's positions in the format "pos_a~pos_b". It parses the positions using `_parse_pos` and returns a `Brick` object.
   - `_parse_input`: This function takes a string and parses it into a list of `Brick` objects using `_parse_single_brick`.
   - `_sort_bricks`: This function sorts the list of bricks based on the minimum value of the z-coordinate of each brick's positions.
   - `_get_min_z`: This function takes a `Brick` object and returns the minimum value of its z-coordinate.

3. Following the helper functions, there are several functions that extract coordinates from a `Brick` object:

   - `_get_x`: Returns the x-coordinate of a `Brick` object.
   - `_get_y`: Returns the y-coordinate of a `Brick` object.
   - `_get_z`: Returns the z-coordinate of a `Brick` object.
   - `_get_range`: Returns a range object representing the range between two input values.

4. The next set of functions deal with occupied space by a brick:

   - `_get_occupied_space`: Takes a `Brick` object and returns a list of coordinates occupied by the brick in the three-dimensional space.
   - `_move_in_z`: Takes a list of occupied space coordinates and a new z-coordinate. It adjusts the z-coordinate of each coordinate to match the new z-coordinate and returns the updated list.
   - `_does_not_intersect`: Takes a list of other bricks and a brick, and checks if the brick intersects with any of the other bricks.
   - `_find_min_z_space`: Takes a list of occupied space coordinates and a brick's space coordinates. It finds the minimum z-coordinate where the brick can be placed without intersecting with other bricks and returns that z-coordinate.
   - `_find_min_z`: Takes a list of occupied space coordinates and a brick. It computes the occupied space coordinates of the brick and calls `_find_min_z_space` to find the minimum z-coordinate for the brick.

5. The `_fall` function is responsible for simulating the falling of bricks and updating the occupied space:

   - It initializes two dictionaries: `space_to_id` maps coordinates to brick IDs, and `id_to_space` maps brick IDs to their occupied space coordinates.
   - For each brick in the input list:
     - It finds the minimum z-coordinate where the brick can be placed without intersecting with other bricks.
     - It adjusts the z-coordinate of the brick's occupied space coordinates to match the minimum z-coordinate.
     - It updates the `space_to_id` and `id_to_space` dictionaries accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the updated `space_to_id` and `id_to_space` dictionaries.

6. The `_max_z_of_occupied_space` and `_min_z_of_occupied_space` functions return the maximum and minimum z-coordinates, respectively, among the occupied space coordinates of a brick.
7. The `_get_all_xy` function returns a set of all x-y coordinates from the occupied space coordinates of a brick.
8. The `_get_supports` function determines the bricks that are supported by each brick:

   - It iterates over each brick in `id_to_space` and:
     - Determines the z-coordinate above the brick's occupied space coordinates.
     - Checks if there is a brick at that position in `space_to_id`.
     - If there is, it adds the supporting brick's ID to the set of supports for the current brick.
   - Finally, it returns a dictionary where each brick ID is mapped to the set of IDs of bricks that support it.

9. The `_get_supported_by` function determines the bricks that support each brick:

   - It iterates over each brick in `id_to_space` and:
     - Determines the z-coordinate below the brick's occupied space coordinates.
     - Checks if there is a brick at that position in `space_to_id`.
     - If there is, it adds the supported brick's ID to the set of supported by IDs for the current brick.
   - Finally, it returns a dictionary where each brick ID is mapped to the set of IDs of bricks that support it.

10. The `_can_be_removed` functionThe `_can_be_removed` function checks if a particular brick can be safely removed without causing any other bricks to fall. It takes the ID of the brick to be removed and the `supports` and `supported_by` dictionaries as input.

The function first checks if the brick has any supports. If it does, it means there are other bricks below it that are supporting it, and removing it would cause those bricks to fall. In this case, the function returns False.

If the brick does not have any supports, the function checks if there are any bricks that it supports. If there are, it means the brick is supporting other bricks above it, and removing it would cause those bricks to fall. In this case, the function returns False.

If the brick has neither supports nor supported bricks, it means it is not supporting any bricks and is not being supported by any bricks. In this case, the function returns True, indicating that the brick can be safely removed.

11. The `remove_brick` function is responsible for removing a brick and updating the occupied space and support relationships:

- It first checks if the brick can be safely removed by calling the `_can_be_removed` function. If not, it raises a ValueError with an appropriate error message.
- If the brick can be safely removed, it updates the `space_to_id` and `id_to_space` dictionaries by removing the brick's occupied space coordinates and ID.
- It also updates the `supports` and `supported_by` dictionaries by removing any references to the brick's ID.

12. Finally, the `main` function is defined:

- It takes a string as input, which represents the list of bricks in the format specified in the problem statement.
- It parses the input string using the `_parse_input` function to obtain a list of `Brick` objects.
- It calls the `_fall` function to simulate the falling of the bricks and obtain the updated `space_to_id` and `id_to_space` dictionaries.
- It calls the `_get_supports` function to obtain the `supports` dictionary.
- It calls the `_get_supported_by` function to obtain the `supported_by` dictionary.
- It iterates over each brick in the list of bricks and checks if it can be safely removed using the `_can_be_removed` function. If a brick can be removed, its ID is added to a set called `removable_bricks`.
- It prints the IDs of the bricks that can be safely removed.
