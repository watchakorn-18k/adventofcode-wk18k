**1. Helper Functions:**

- **\_to_pos(in_x, in_y):** Converts x and y coordinates into a tuple for easier representation.
- **\_shift(in_pos, in_dir):** Shifts a position (tuple) in a specific direction (provided as a tuple).
- **\_gen_all_shifted(getter, in_pos, visited, cur_step):** Generates valid adjacent positions for exploration, considering accessible spaces and avoiding revisiting past states.

**2. Input Parsing and Grid Representation:**

- **parse_input(in_str):** Reads the input string, parses it into a grid-like dictionary, and extracts dimensions and starting position.
- **get_getter(in_plan, in_x_size, in_y_size):** Creates a function to access grid values, handling infinite wrapping for out-of-bounds coordinates.

**3. Reachability Calculation:**

- **count_accessible(getter, in_start_pos, in_steps):** Counts the number of reachable fields within a given number of steps using a breadth-first search algorithm.

**4. Part A Solution:**

- **solve_a(in_str):** Solves Part A by parsing the input, creating a getter function, and calling `count_accessible` with 64 steps.

**5. Optimization for Large Steps (Part B):**

- **\_single_iteration(in_a, in_b, in_c):** Performs a single iteration of a pattern observed in reachability counts for large steps.
- **\_iterate(initial_vals, in_iterations):** Applies multiple iterations of the pattern based on initial values and a specified number of iterations.
- **\_compute_diffs(in_vals):** Calculates initial values for the iteration process based on initial reachability counts.

**6. Part B Solution:**

- **solve_b(in_str):** Solves Part B by leveraging the optimization for large steps:
  - Uses reachability counts for initial steps to compute initial values for iteration.
  - Iterates the pattern to efficiently compute the final reachability count for the large number of steps.

**7. Main Execution:**

- Reads input from a file named "input".
- Prints solutions for Part A and Part B using the respective functions.
